Are you looking to learn more about the key features and functionalities built into spaCy? Look no further. Itâ€™s time to get up to speed with using the extensive spaCy library to solve complex natural language processing tasks. Join instructor Prateek Sawhney in this advanced skills development course, as he demonstrates business-critical approaches and techniques to solving problems in rule-based AI and machine learning.

Learn the basics of how to leverage the complex and advanced spaCy library to address real-world technical problems. From text processing to data analysis, processing pipelines, and training an artificial neural network, Prateek helps you get up and running quickly with results-driven problem-solving tasks. Along the way, you can test out your new skills in the exercise challenges at the end of each section.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
